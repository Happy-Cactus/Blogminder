#Blogminder

An Android app that pulls an RSS feed and checks the last posted date.
If it's been a while since the last post, you will get a reminder.

This is mostly an experiment with alarms, services and notifications.

Unit tests will be added as soon as the basic functionality of the repeating alarm is implemented.
